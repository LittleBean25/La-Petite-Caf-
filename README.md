# Online Cafe Management System (OCMS)

## 📖 Overview

The **Online Cafe Management System (OCMS)** is a full-featured web-based application designed to modernize and digitize the operational and customer-facing processes of cafes.

## 📚 Background of the Study

The rapid evolution of information technology has triggered a digital transformation across industries — and the food and beverage sector is no exception. Modern cafes are increasingly moving away from manual, paper-based systems toward automated, real-time platforms. The OCMS emerges as a timely and necessary innovation to support this shift, empowering cafe owners to:

- Streamline operations
- Reduce service errors
- Enhance customer satisfaction
- Boost data accuracy and reporting

## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional manual processes in cafes result in:
- Delayed and error-prone order processing
- Inaccurate inventory records
- Inefficient customer handling
- Poor reporting and analytics

These limitations negatively impact both the business and its customers. As modern consumers demand speed, convenience, and digital experiences, there's an urgent need for a robust system that meets both operational and customer-facing demands.
